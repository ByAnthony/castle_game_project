## Original Game
The Castle Card Game is an original game created by Loic Marles and designed by Anthony Byledbal. It was developed as an educational game for which the players could learn more about medieval castles. It was never released as a physical game because the cost of production were too expensive, but find its way to the digital world.

## Gameplay

### Rules

The Goal is to be the first to build your castle.

To ensure your victory you must complete **2 objectives**:
1. Gathering all necessary material cards (Money, Wood, Stone, Mortar, Labour);
2. Amassing 20 points or more with the tool cards.

Your opponent can also **sabotage** your material cards by using an **attack card**. These attacks are:
- Bankruptcy to sabotage Money;
- Fire to sabotage Wood;
- Shortage to sabotage Stone;
- Frost to sabotage Mortar;
- Plague to sabotage Labour.

Luckily you have **defence cards** that you can use to thwart the enemies attack on your materials. These defence cards include:
- Loan to defend against Bankruptcy;
- Water to defend against Fire;
- Quarry to defend against Shortage;
- Thaw to defend against Frost;
- Apothecary to defend against Plague.

If an attack is successful and the player has no defence, the material card that was attacked is discarded along with the attack card used by your opponent.

If the player has a defence card to protect his materials, then both the defence and attack cards are discarded and the material card stays in play.

### Walkthrough

At the start of the game each player gets 5 cards in hand.

Each turn a player must play a card on the table and draws a new card. If a player has no cards to play he must discard one from their hand.
